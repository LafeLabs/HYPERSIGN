Welcome to the home of the dirty kid rescue team! 
We are a traveling troupe of crusty punks hippies and folks that are constantly traveling around the country <3 
Our mission is to provide mutual aid, harm reduction and community support to the community of dirty kids and travelers all across the country!
We pass out backpacks, sleeping bags, tarps, tents, socks, shoes, warm meals, kind faces, narcan and anything else we come across that can help folks who are living out of their backpacks full time <3
The founder of the mission posts about all of our adventures destinations and fundraising goals on tiktok under the username @JoannaKropo

Love y'all family
