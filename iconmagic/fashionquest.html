LOOK AT THE INSECTS!

<h1>TRASH MAGIC FASHION QUEST!</h1>

<P>FASHION QUEST IS A QUEST TO REPLICATE FASHION USING WASTE STREAMS!</P>

<p>BEGIN WITH THE FREE PANTS!</p>



<P>THE TWO THINGS WHICH MAKE SOMETHING 100% FASHION QUEST ARE THAT THE FASHION IS MADE OF TRASH AND THAT IT'S SELF-REPLICATING.  I USE TRASH TO MAKE AT THING WHICH ADVERTISES ITS OWN REPLICATION, AND THAT'S TRASH MAGIC.  THAT'S THE TRASH MAGIC FASHION QUEST, TO ACHIEVE REPLICATION AND TO THEN INCREASE THE R NUMBER AND INCREASE THE GAIN AND OUR CONTROL OVER THE PROCESS, OUR ABILITY TO MUTATE THE THING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO TRASH MAGIC.  WE CAN MAKE THE WHOLE TRASH MAGIC SYSTEM BE WEARABLE, WITH WEB SERVERS AND SOLAR PANELS AND ROUTERS AND SYNTHESIZERS AND CUBES AND SQUARES AND SO ON.</P>

<P>
    GATHER CLOTHES FROM THE STREET, WASH THEM, CUT THEM UP, RESTITCH THEM, AND FORM THEM INTO CLOTHES!  OUR STYLE IS MAXIMALIST!  WE ADD AS MUCH MATERIAL AS WE CAN, THE MORE MATERIAL WE ADD, THE MORE WASTE GETS USED!  WE ADD MORE AND MORE POCKETS AS WE GET MORE MATERIAL!
</P>

<P>
WE USE THE TRASH MAGIC FONT, WHICH IS A 4 INCH SQUARE CUT OUT FROM CLOTH AND THEN SHAPED INTO A LETTER BY REMOVING AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE!
